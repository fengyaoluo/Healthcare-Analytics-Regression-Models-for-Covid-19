# Healthcare-Analytics-Regression-Models-for-Covid-19

COVID-19 has been an emerging and rapidly evolving enemy that the world is fighting with. It was on Feb
6th 2020 that the United States saw its first covid-19 related death and ever since then the nation has been at
unrest. The onset of the virus has since completely altered the ways in which people interact with each other
and in public spaces. The purpose of this lab exercise is to investigate the cause of variation in infections
across the 50 states (and 1 special district) with the emphasis on the public policies, while controlling for
other demographic parameters.

Specifically, we are hypothesizing a casual relationship between states enforcing the mandatory mask-wearing
policy and controlling the spread of COVD-19. 

Our research question thus is:
**How much does a mandatory mask-wearing policy slow the spread of COVID-19 while accounting
for the demographic feature variation such as density, poverty or susceptible population?**

The dataset for this research was compiled on July 6th from surveys and census. Due to a few issues noted
with the data, data cleansing and transformation were performed to prepare for model fitting. No additional
variables were added.
